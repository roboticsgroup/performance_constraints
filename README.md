Manipulator Performance Constraints for human-robot Cooperation

# Description:
Use any local performance index of a robotic manipulator to constrain the robot above a certain threshold.
This is particularly useful for singularity avoidance in physical human-robot interaction

A detailed description can be found in the following RCIM paper:
- Dimeas, Fotios, Vassilis C. Moulianitis, and Nikos Aspragathos. "Manipulator performance constraints in human-robot cooperation." Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (2017).

and also in ICRA 2016 (early version):
- Dimeas, Fotios, et al. "Manipulator performance constraints in Cartesian admittance control for human-robot cooperation." Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.

This repository includes the Matlab code that was used in the ICRA 2016 paper and the extended method in C++ that is presented in the RCIM journal. 

The C++ implementation includes performance constraints in both translational and rotational axes. It also includes 2 ways of calculating them:
* Serial: Each direction is calculated after the other. 
* Parallel: Each direction is calculated in its own thread worker. Function returns when all calculations are over. 

For 6 and 7 DOF robots, execution time has been measured around 0.2ms


# Usage:
## ROS & C++
Load robot description 
> ros2 launch ur_description display_platform_right.launch.py 

Run example
> ros2 run performance_constraints demo

The Jacobian matrix is calculated from the URDF using a simulated robot

### Requirements:
- [arl_core2](https://gitlab.com/proghrc/arl_core2_ws)

## Matlab
1. Set the desired parameters for the robot and the performance
constraints
2. Run the simulation
3. View the simulated motion of the robot and the plots

### Requirements:
- Robotics Toolbox for Matlab (http://www.petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html)

### Notes: 
- The simulation does not consider the joint limits so the robot might behave weird
- This code has been tested with Robotics Toolbox 9.10 and Matlab R2014a
